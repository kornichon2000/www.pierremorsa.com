Here are a few AppleScript libraries that I developed for my own use, but that some of you may find useful. These libraries are used by my Keyboard Maestro Actions, and should be installed first.

## AppleScript OmniFocusLibrary
I built this library to fit my own needs, so it is by no means complete. However, it offers several useful functions and procedures to simplify scripting. This library is necessary to use the OmniFocus Keyboard Maestro Actions.
