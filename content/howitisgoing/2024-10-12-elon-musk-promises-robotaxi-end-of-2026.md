Elon promised that the robotaxi, named Cybercab, would be ready and available in two years from now (source: [the Verge, one of the few news sites that still employs journalists with functioning brain cells](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24267727/tesla-cybercab-unanswered-questions-fsd-safety-liability)). I'm generous, I will give him until end of December 2026. The second claim he made was that it would cost under $30,000.

Not going to happen. Will not be ready by 2026 and will cost more than $30,000.
