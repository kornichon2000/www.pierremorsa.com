During the Q1 2023 earnings call on April 19, 2023, Elon Musk announced that the first Cybertruck deliveries would take place in Q3 2023. Technically, that means September 30th latest. Source: [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2023/04/19/elon-musk-announces-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-event/)

Here we are. To nobody's surprise, Q3 went by and not a single Cybertruck was delivered to customers. My bet is that during the next earnings call, Elon will claim that the first Cybertrucks will be delivered sometime in 2024. At one point he will complain again that making Cybertrucks is hard.
