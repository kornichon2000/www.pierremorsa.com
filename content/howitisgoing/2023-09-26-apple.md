**How it started**: during the iPhone event of September 2023, Apple made a movie claiming it plans to be carbon neutral by 2030. As of September 2023, it’s right there on their YouTube channel:

**My prognosis**: they will not reach that goal, not by a long shot. When you are one of the biggest producers of electronics on the planet, it is impossible, especially when you are (mostly) against the right to repair and design devices with very low repairability scores. It’s wishful thinking at best and pure PR bullshit at worst. At some point, the movie will be discreetly removed from Apple's materials. 

**How it is going**: not there yet.
