The Full Self Driving story started back in 2013, but I'm not going that far back in time, partly because my own recollection of events is fuzzy about what Elon claimed back then. I'm starting from this year, and Elon declared that with v12, Full Self Driving was going out of beta (therefore implying for the general public that it will indeed be true Full Self Driving).

As of 2023-09-28, your Tesla still can't fetch your bread and newspaper for you.

In October 2016, Tesla released a promotional video entitled "Full Self-Driving Hardware on All Teslas." It was later admitted by employees that the video had been very carefully prepared and edited.
