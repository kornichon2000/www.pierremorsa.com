On Monday April 8, 2024, Elon said that AI will be smarter than any human around the end of next year (next year being 2025).

I am not making this shit up, here is a reputable source: [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/elon-musk-ai-will-be-smarter-than-any-human-around-the-end-of-next-year/)
