To her credit, she said "in early '24." She didn't specify if she meant 2024 or 3024. Profitability claims are a bit tricky. It is possible to use accounting methods to temporarily boost the profits of companies. So I think this claim is unlikely, but not 100% impossible. Long term profits? To my chagrin I must admit that Twitter still has a possibility of achieving that goal.
