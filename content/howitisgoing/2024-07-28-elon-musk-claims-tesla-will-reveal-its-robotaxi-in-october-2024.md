Elon previously claimed [he would reveal the robotaxi on August 8th, 2024, but backpedaled during the earnings call.](https://www.pierremorsa.com/howitisgoing/2024-04-06-elon-claims-testla-will-reveal-its-robot-taxi-on-august-8/)

I was wrong the first time. I thought he would present something on August 8th, but it did not happen. I don't know what's going to happen in October, but don't expect a robotaxi that is actually ready for full-scale deployment beyond what Waymo is currently doing.

Yes, Elon announced a robotaxi on October. He made some sort of demo that raised a lot of questions. He made the typical list of bombastic promises that he is known for, so many that I will not bother tracking them all.

I will, however, add two of his promises to this blog: 1/ that the robotaxi will cost $30,000 and 2/ that it will be ready in two years from now.
